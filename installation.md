# Fetching Data

The initial nycmap.osm is generated by downloading a file via Overpass Turbo. nycmap is not
saved to source control because of its large size.

We then run:

```
osmium tags-filter src/assets/nycmap.osm "w/highway=*" -o nyc_roads_only.osm.pbf
```

to filter the output to only roads. Note that osmium cli needs to be installed. This is also not saved
to source control.
